	Hi and welcome! I am a researcher specialized in political behavior and statistical data analysis. Currently I work as a post-doc at the <a href="https://www.ceu.edu/">Central European University</a> in Budapest, where I do data analysis and management for the <a href="http://cupesse.eu/">CUPESSE</a> project. I also teach statistics and research methods, and occasionally I hold workshops on statistical software.
