	Hi! I am an assistant professor in political science at the <a href="https://www.dcps.unito.it/do/home.pl" target="_blank">Department of Cultures, Politics and Society</a> of the University of Turin (Italy). I do research on political behavior, communication and psychology. I teach political science, quantitative research methods, and occasionally I hold workshops on statistical software.
