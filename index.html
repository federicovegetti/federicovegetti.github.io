	Hi and welcome! I am a researcher specialized in political behavior and statistical data analysis. Currently I work as a post-doc at the <a href="https://www.dcps.unito.it/do/home.pl" target="_blank">Department of Cultures, Politics and Society</a> of the University of Turin (Italy). I also teach political science, statistics and research methods, and occasionally I hold workshops on statistical software.
