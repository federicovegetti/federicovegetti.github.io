	Hi and welcome! I am a researcher specialized in political behavior and statistical data analysis. Currently I work as a post-doc at the <a href="http://eng.sps.unimi.it/ecm/home" target="_blank">Department of Social and Political Sciences</a> of the University of Milan (Italy). I also teach statistics and research methods, and occasionally I hold workshops on statistical software.
