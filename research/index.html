<p>In my research I apply statistical data analysis techniques to answering relevant questions in social and behavioral sciences. This includes voting behavior, public opinion formation, political attitudes and perceptions, economic behavior and reforms. See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research/papers.html">here</a> for a list of my papers.</p>

<p>Most of my work focuses on how individual psychological processes interact with characteristics of the broader context, affecting observed behaviors and opinions. For example, I have been looking at various implications of political <b>polarization</b>. How do citizens behave politically when preferences diverge and the overall political climate is conflictual? In my research I tackle this question focusing on different phenomena, like political knowledge, party evaluations, and patterns of voting behavior.</p>

<p>Much empirical research in political science is based on <b>perceptions</b>. However, perceptions can be biased, and biases can occur in some contexts more than in others. Borrowing from social and cognitive psychology, I have looked at mechanisms that can affect political perceptions, such as categorization and motivated reasoning, and how they are activated in different contexts based on the political elites' discourse.</p>

<p>I have also worked on the implications of belief in <b>conspiracy theories</b>, in particular whether this is associated to populist attitudes and endorsement of political violence.</p>

<p>More recently I have focused on <b>entrepreneurship</b>, looking at the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on people's entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviors across European countries, and at the characteristics of the macroeconomic context that managed to moderate it.</p>
