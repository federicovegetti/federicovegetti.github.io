title: Introduction to Experimental Research in the Social Sciences (2017)
---

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

	<p>This is an introductory course to experimental design that I have been teaching in summer 2017 at the <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/EventTypeDetails.aspx?EventTypeID=5">ECPR Summer School in Methods and Techniques</a>. Experiments are a fundamental tool for research in a wide array of disciplines, including social and behavioral sciences. Furthermore, the increasing ease to collect great amounts of customer and user data has made experimental research a common encounter in the private sector as well (e.g. A/B testing). This course is an introduction to experimental research in the social sciences, with a particular focus on political science.</p>

	<p>The course schedule and reading list (and a creepy picture of myself) are available <a href="https://ecpr.eu/Events/PanelDetails.aspx?PanelID=7050&EventID=116">here</a>.</p>
