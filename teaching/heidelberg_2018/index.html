title: Introduction to Survey Statistics
---

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

	<p>In January 2018 I was invited to teach a short course on survey statistics at the <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/personal/tosun/index_en.html" target="_blank">Chair of Political Science</a> at the University of Heidelberg (Germany), headed by my friend and colleague <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/personal/tosun/person/" target="_blank">Jale Tosun</a>.</p>

	<p>The course was meant to introduce the students to the issues that we all encounter when working with survey data, as well as to the perks of working with <tt>R</tt> for survey data analysis. It consisted of three theoretical sessions (general intro to survey methodology/design; sampling & weighting; measurement) and two practical sessions (intro to <tt>R</tt> and <tt>dplyr</tt>; working with survey weights with <tt>R</tt> using the <tt>srvyr</tt> and the <tt>survey</tt> packages).</p>

	<p>The course drew shamelessly from two books: "<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Survey+Methodology%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470465462" target="_blank">Survey Methodology</a>" by Robert Groves and colleagues, and "<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Complex+Surveys%3A+A+Guide+to+Analysis+Using+R-p-9780470284308" target="_blank">Complex Surveys: A Guide to Analysis Using R</a>" by Thomas Lumley (who is also responsible for the famous <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/" target="_blank"><tt>survey</tt></a> package for <tt>R</tt>).</p>

	<p>Below you can find the slides, as well as the <tt>R</tt> scripts for the two lab sessions.</p>
