	<p>Here you can find the materials for some methods classes that I have taught in the past. I put them here cause they might be useful to somebody. When possible I am happy to provide slides and scripts. Data are available upon request.</p>

	<p>You won't find any material for the theoretical classes that I taught, nor for the classes that I'm teaching currently. If you need something about those, please write me an email.</p>
